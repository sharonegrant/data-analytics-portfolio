# Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio. This repository is a curated collection of projects that demonstrate the skills and techniques I use as a senior data analytics professional. Each project addresses a realistic business question and follows a clear workflow:

1. **Problem Statement** – what business question am I trying to answer?
2. **Data & Cleaning** – where does the data come from, and how is it cleaned and prepared for analysis?
3. **Exploration & Methods** – what analysis techniques, models, or experiments are used to answer the question?
4. **Findings & Impact** – what insights were uncovered and how could they influence business decisions?
5. **Limitations & Next Steps** – what constraints should stakeholders be aware of?

## Projects

Below are the flagship projects included in this portfolio. Each subfolder contains all the necessary code, notebooks, and outputs to reproduce the work.

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| **Cleaning & QA** | Demonstrates rigorous data cleaning and quality assurance for a messy dataset. Includes scripts/notebooks for profiling, handling missing values, and validating data integrity. |
| **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Story** | Uses Python notebooks to explore a dataset, identify patterns, and build a narrative using visualizations. Demonstrates feature engineering and storytelling for stakeholders. |
| **A/B Test** | Designs and analyzes an A/B test to compare two versions of a feature or product change. Includes experiment design, statistical tests, and business recommendations. |
| **Forecasting** | Builds a time‐series or predictive model to forecast key metrics. Shows how to evaluate model performance and communicate forecast confidence. |
| **Dashboard Demo** | A stakeholder‐facing dashboard built in Power BI or Tableau. The published link or embed code allows recruiters and managers to click through the interactive visualization. |
