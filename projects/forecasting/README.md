# Forecasting Project

This project builds a predictive model to forecast future values of a business metric (e.g., sales, demand, traffic).

## Contents

- `data/` – historical dataset used for training and validation
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebook(s) developing the forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)
- `src/` – reusable scripts for model training and evaluation
- `reports/` – summary of results and visualizations of forecasts

## Overview

1. **Problem Statement** – What metric is being forecast and why is it important?
2. **Data & Preparation** – Describe the historical data, time range, and preprocessing steps.
3. **Modeling** – Explain the chosen model(s), hyperparameters, and evaluation strategy.
4. **Results** – Present the forecast results, accuracy metrics, and confidence intervals.
5. **Limitations** – Note potential sources of error, seasonality, and external factors.
