# Dashboard Demo

This project contains an example of an interactive dashboard created using a tool like Power BI or Tableau. The dashboard should be publicly accessible and demonstrate your ability to build stakeholder-facing visualizations.

## Contents

- `data/` – the dataset used to build the dashboard (or a link to it)
- `src/` – scripts used to prepare the data for the dashboard
- `dashboard/` – files or links to the published dashboard; if using Power BI, include the `pbix` file and the public web link; if using Tableau Public, link to the Tableau viz.
- `screenshots/` – static images or GIFs of the dashboard

## Overview

1. **Problem Statement** – Describe the purpose of the dashboard and the questions it helps answer.
2. **Design Considerations** – Explain the layout, metrics, and filters included.
3. **Highlights** – Point out key insights and how a user should interact with the dashboard.
4. **Limitations** – Note any constraints due to anonymization or sample data.

When you publish the dashboard, replace the placeholder with the actual link and update this file accordingly.
