# Cleaning & QA Project

This project demonstrates rigorous data cleaning and quality assurance on a raw dataset. The goal is to ensure the data is trustworthy and ready for analysis.

## Contents

- `data/` – contains the raw and cleaned datasets or links to the source data
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebook(s) showing the cleaning steps: profiling, handling missing values, correcting data types, and validating integrity
- `src/` – Python scripts or functions for reusable cleaning functions
- `reports/` – any generated reports or summaries

## Overview

1. **Problem Statement** – A messy dataset is provided that includes missing values, inconsistent formats, and possible duplicates. The objective is to produce a cleaned dataset ready for analysis.
2. **Data & Cleaning** – Describe the original data source and the cleaning steps applied.
3. **Findings** – Summarize any insights or patterns discovered during the cleaning process.
4. **Limitations** – Note any assumptions or decisions made that might affect downstream analysis.
